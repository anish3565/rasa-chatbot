# 🤖 Rasa Chatbot - Personal Info Collector

A conversational AI chatbot built using the Rasa framework. This bot greets users, collects their age and phone number using forms, handles mood-based conversation, and replies to general greetings and goodbyes.

## 🚀 Features

- Greets and farewells users
- Collects user's age and phone number via a form
- Responds based on user mood (happy or sad)
- Answers bot-related challenges (e.g., "Are you a bot?")
- Rule-based and story-based conversation flow
- Handles free-text number input using entity extraction

## 💡 How It Works

### 🔍 Intent Recognition
Defined in `nlu.yml`, e.g., `greet`, `goodbye`, `questions`, `mood_great`, `bot_challenge`.

### 🧠 Dialogue Flow
- **Forms**: Used to collect structured data like age and phone number.
- **Rules**: Hardcoded responses like answering "Are you a bot?"
- **Stories**: More flexible interactions that define full conversational flows.

### 🎯 Entity Extraction
The entity `number` is used to recognize age and phone numbers from free-text input.

### 🗂 Form Logic
The `question_form` is activated on `greet` and asks:
- `utter_ask_age`
- `utter_ask_number`

All slot mappings are defined in `domain.yml`.
